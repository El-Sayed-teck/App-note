# App-note
An app note made from html css and javascript

This is a note app made by me, you can add, save, update and delete notes as many as you want.

Every created note has a date and time automatically get from your computer when you create a note, and when you edit it date and time get updated automatically, This behavior ensures that both the creation date/time and last modified date/time are always current and accurate. 

note: the background image is a digital illustartion made by me, so i didn't use an free copyrighted image or third party external libraries, so this app is 100% mine and all the credits belong to me.
